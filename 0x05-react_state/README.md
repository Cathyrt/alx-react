## State of a Component or Container

State refers to the data that a component or container holds internally. It represents the dynamic aspect of your UI and can change over time. Understanding how to manage and update state is fundamental in React development.

## Lifecycle of a Component

React components go through various lifecycle stages, including mounting, updating, and unmounting. These stages provide opportunities to execute code at specific points during a component's existence.

## Modifying State and Executing Code

Learn how to correctly modify state and perform actions in the right order to ensure your components behave as expected and provide a smooth user experience.

## Controlled Components

Controlled components are React components where the value of form elements is controlled by the component's state. This approach enables better control and validation of form data.

## Using Forms in React

Forms play a crucial role in user interactions. Discover how to handle form submission, manage input elements, and validate user input using React.

## Reusing Smaller Components

Creating smaller, reusable components promotes cleaner and more maintainable code. Explore strategies for designing and utilizing reusable components effectively.

## Lifting State to Principal Containers

When multiple components need access to the same state, lifting the state to a common parent (principal container) can simplify state management and data sharing.

## Using React Hooks

React hooks provide a way to add state and other React features to functional components. Learn how to create custom hooks and leverage built-in hooks for enhanced functionality.

## Testing State Changes with Enzyme

Enzyme is a testing utility for React that facilitates testing component behaviors and state changes. Discover how to write tests to ensure your state changes are correctly handled.
